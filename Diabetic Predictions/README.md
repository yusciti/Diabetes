### * Introduction
 The project is all about Diabetics Prediction
This dataset named Diabetes is a dataset which give us an information about the patient Diabetes status. 
In which the status dependeds on many factors which i will be discussing as i move further. The goal of the project is to use predictive models 
to predict if a patient is diabetics or not base on the given data. In this project i will forcus on Regression
 The dataset downloaded from kaggle
The scope of the projects are data cleaning, data visualization and insight. And also to test my Machine learning knowledge in Algorithm usage,
 feature (selection and engineering)&
 metrics evaluation

### * Requirements
 IDE - Jupyter notebook or Anaconda

Python Packages and liberaries installation
 *	 pandas
 *   matplotlib
 *	numpy
 
# Why do i need this liberaries
 The liberaries will make you have accesss to the modules you will be using this project


# How do i contribute?
 You can submit a pull request to the code or content in the Github repo, I will include the content and likewise change the code as recommended
If you hve any suggestions or discovered any error, please report them as [issues](https://github.com/yusciti/diabetes/issues)

### NOTE
This project insight is based on my angle of view, you can explore and view beyond my own view to bring in addition insight, l
ikewise different Algorithm can be used for the prediction
